# Plant_Watering_App_React.NET

A plant database CRUD-like WEB app, where you can keep track of the plants you have at home and remember to water them. Just clone the project, run dotnet restore and dotnet run from the main folder in your favorite compiler, and nagivate to the client folder to npm install and npm start. All functions work in localhost:5000.
